## 💡 How It Works (Simple & Smart)

1.  **Capture:** The user opens the app and takes a clear photo of the plant they need help with.
2.  **Analyze:** The photo is processed by a specialized computer vision model trained on millions of plant images to accurately determine the species.
3.  **Contextualize:** The identified plant name is fed into the large language model (LLM), which accesses its vast knowledge base of horticultural data.
4.  **Communicate:** The LLM powers the interactive chat interface, allowing the user to ask specific, follow-up questions and receive instant, personalized advice formatted in an easy-to-understand way.
